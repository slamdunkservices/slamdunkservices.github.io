Slam Dunk is a group of data professionals (scientists, engineers, analysts) who were working together in day jobs when sports betting was legalized in Illinois. 
We built a set of tools to pull data from the NBA and use it to train models to predict the probability of events in NBA games.
We also developed tools that check the odds at sportsbooks to identify plays where our models suggest the sportsbooks' have favorable odds, and that alert us when edges appear.
