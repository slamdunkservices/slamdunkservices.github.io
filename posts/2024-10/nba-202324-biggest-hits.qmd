As we get ready for the next NBA season, we're taking a look back at our 2023-24 NBA betting performance. Here were the top 10 biggest hits (by units returned):

-   Dean Wade, first player to score exact method 2-pointer, Jan 1 2024
    -   +8000 odds at MGM, 1.2u wager, 97u return
    -   HAPPY NEW YEAR! Wade rarely took the first shot, and tended toward 3-pointers, so MGM gave us that big line.
-   Vince Williams Jr., first player to score exact method 2-pointer, Jan 13 2024
    -   +5000 odds at MGM, 1.5u wager, 74u return
    -   Vince showed up 43 times in our plays, almost always at MGM, and hit 6 of them
-   Noah Clowney, first player to score exact method 2-pointer, Apr 12 2024
    -   +2200 at Draftkings, 3u wager, 65u ROI
    -   This shot shows up twice - the beauty of correlated markets!
-   Scottie Barnes, first player to score exact method 3-pointer, Dec 23 2023
    -   +7000 at Fanduel, 0.9u wager, 65u ROI

-   Noah Clowney, first player to score by team exact method 2-pointer, Apr 12 2024

-   Markelle Fultz, first 3-pointer by team, Feb 6 2024
    -   +4000 at Draftkings, 1.1u wager, 46u ROI
    -   Fultz was overall a 10.3 unit return, so it was basically this and then nothing else
