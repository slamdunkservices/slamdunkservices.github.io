    "text": "With the 2024-25 NBA season about to kickoff, we thought it would be prudent to remind everybody about our performance last year. Here‚Äôs a graph tracking our 1692 units of ROI over the course of the 2023-24 NBA season. This graph includes all of our prop markets, which you can check out in the FAQ.\n\nThe horizontal axis is ‚Äúbet number‚Äù, which is just the index of bets we‚Äôve made - far left is the first bet we made of the season, far right is the last one. The vertical axis is ‚Äúunits returned‚Äù which just counts the NET units returned from the bet. When the line goes up, we‚Äôre winning, when it goes down, we‚Äôre losing.\nSome things to call out:\n\nObviously this line is not flat, which means that we had ups and downs.\nThe line ends a LOT higher than when it began! 1692 units higher, in fact.\nWe make a LOT of bets - this chart included 17,558 data points!\nWhile we had some plays that made the line go straight up (we‚Äôll write some separate posts on those, but bless Noah Clowney), the majority of the return is grinding away with incremental wins.\n\nThis is the first of our recaps, but definitely not the last. Thanks a lot for reading, holler if you have any questions (@slam_dunk_bets is the best way to find us), and please consider subscribing if you haven‚Äôt yet üôè\n(And if 1692 units of profit isn‚Äôt enough, well, idk what else we can say!)"

    "title": "How Do You Predict First Baskets? Part 3 of ‚Ä¶",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the previous post on predicting first baskets, we walked through the data we use for the models. Next we‚Äôll talk through the models themselves. This will get kinda long and nerdy!\nWe build a LOT of models. For each modeling problem, we typically build three unique kinds of models (e.g.¬†regression, decision trees, splines) and combine them via a technique called ensembling. Ensemble models build off the idea of the wisdom of the crowds, a phenomena where often times the average estimate of something, like the weight of a cow, from a big crowd of people, is a better predictor of that thing than the estimates of experts. In ensemble models, we replace the crowd of people with a bunch of predictions from models, and try to do some smart weighting of the different input models as we get evidence about which models are most reliable.\nBut there‚Äôs more! Sometimes, the inputs to a model aren‚Äôt always available for every player or team - for instance, we can‚Äôt use any statistics that reference a previous season for rookies, or a 20-game average of a metric for a player or team who hasn‚Äôt played 20 games. So we build sets of models, called reduced models, to handle these different cases, and then use a process called reconciliation to align the outputs, which is important in cases where we‚Äôre using different models for different players in the same games.\nSupporting all these models present a challenge for orchestration, i.e.¬†figuring out which models to use in different situations, but has so far given us far stronger results than other approaches to the problem of predictors not always being available for every case that needs a prediction (like imputation).\nSo, to the models! Here‚Äôs that diagram again: \nThe first are the jump ball models, which predict the likelihood of a specific jumper to win the tip against another specific jumper, e.g.¬†Anthony Davis to win the tip against Bam Adebayo or vice versa. A player‚Äôs win rate against a specific opponent is almost always the best predictor of the outcome here, but a number of other factors, like a player‚Äôs height, reach, vertical, and overall jump ball win rate are also useful pieces of information.\nOnce we‚Äôve predicted the tipoff winner, we can predict which team will score first. These models use the output of the jump ball models, along with game lines and other team-level stats like offensive efficiency (adjusted for the expected lineup). One note, is that defensive factors rarely explain much variance in first team to score outcomes - there might be some lockdown defensive teams out there, but the majority of the time a team‚Äôs offensive production is most important. These are also the only models in our stack that use odds data from the books, because frankly the models are a lot better performing when we include them; in the future we‚Äôd prefer to remove the dependency on external odds estimates, but for now they work.\nIndependent from the jump ball and first team to score processes, we also model which player will score first for their team. This doesn‚Äôt require any knowledge of who will win the tipoff or which team scores first (we tested that). The most important features in our first team scorer models are focused on usage: players who have a lot of offensive touches early in the game tend to be more likely to score first, but this depends a great deal on who else is in the starting lineup that day and their expected usage.\nThis makes intuitive sense! For instance, if a player is typically a backup Center, they almost certainly have a low likelihood to score first in any given game; but if the starting Center is inactive and the backup moves into the starting lineup, the backup‚Äôs usage pattern has to be higher than what you‚Äôd expect in a ‚Äútypical‚Äù game. Our data support that hypothesis and our models utilize it to a great advantage. (To be fair, the sportsbooks do this with their models too! We just do it better.)\nAt this point we have all the main ingredients for our player to score the first basket for the game models. The most important inputs for these models are, unsurprisingly, the output of the team to score first models and the output of the player to score first for their team models. Most of the other information about player and team performance is already baked into the previous modeling steps!\nThe last pieces to the modeling puzzle are the exact methods for first team to score, first team player, and first player overall, e.g.¬†predicting which player or team will score first and also specifying that it will happen on a two pointer or a free throw or a dunk (different books have different methods available). The most important features of these models are their predecessor models, and shot type trends adjusted for different lineup combinations.\nAnd there it is! We might do some more technical writeups on modeling tools and techniques later down the line, as well as some pieces about how we predict other first events in basketball games (like rebounds or steals). But the next post I‚Äôll do is about how we find and quantify our edges to make play recommendations.\nThanks for reading all this, and if you haven‚Äôt yet, please subscribe to our discord server!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "We mentioned in our series on predicting first baskets that we‚Äôd look at how to time your first basket bets. There‚Äôs not a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù strategy but here‚Äôs some strategies that sometimes seem to work:\n\nPlayer odds can be more favorable earlier in the day, before bettors have had a chance to jump in and pound the +EV lines. NBA and WNBA injury and practice reports are usually not available until later in the day, so there‚Äôs usually more uncertainty in the earlier odds as well. It is far more common for a player‚Äôs edge to start high and end lower, than the reverse, and the biggest hits we‚Äôve had came from odds early in the day but not available later.\nOdds can shift in very meaningful ways right before games tip off, usually due to final starting lineups being announced. This can result in very big edges for players who are typically non-starters. Pay attention to those late alerts!\nBecause odds shift through the day, it is definitely important to keep an eye out on alerts and update your wagers through the day if necessary This almost always means ‚Äúadd more to a bet you‚Äôve wagered on‚Äù (there haven‚Äôt been any clear ‚Äúcash this out‚Äù cases yet) because a player‚Äôs odds improved. We still recommend trying to get the early lines, but maximize your ROI by adding when odds improve.\n\nSo to summarize: get early lines if you can, top ‚Äôem off if odds improve, and pay close attention to alerts around tipoff. Good luck! And if you haven‚Äôt yet, why not subscribe?"

    "text": "Our first post outlined why we bet on first baskets, but doesn‚Äôt say anything at all about how we do it. These next posts will give some more context on our approach for predicting first basket outcomes. This first post will be a super high-level run through the process. Heck, I can even make a little diagram!\n\nI‚Äôll walk through the boxes and arrows.\nFirst, we get a bunch of data from different sources, most importantly play-by-play records from the NBA and WNBA.\nWe use those data to flag the winning player for every jump ball, and who they beat, as well as which players and teams score first and how it happened.\nOnce the data are labeled, we build models to predict the winner of a jump ball between players A and B. These models enable us to predict which team is going to possess the ball first, and knowing which team will possess the ball first is hugely predictive of which team will score first.\nWe could stop here, because ‚Äúplayer to win the tipoff‚Äù and ‚Äúteam to score first‚Äù are popular prop markets in their own rights, but we keep going! Independent of first possession, we can also model which player will score first for their team given a specific lineup; this is also a very popular (and profitable) prop market. Even more, we model out the odds of a player scoring first for their team with a specific method, like a free throw or a three pointer.\nFinally, we can use the outputs of the team to score first and player to score first for their team models, to estimate the odds of a player scoring first for the entire game (and the method they use). Tada!\nNow that you‚Äôve got the high level view, we can start looking more specifically at different parts of the process. We can start with the data!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "First two posts in this series were very high level, now we get into some specifics. What data are we using to predict first basket outcomes?\nThe vast majority of the information we need comes directly from the NBA‚Äôs play-by-play and boxscore records. Here‚Äôs an example of what the NBA generates and freely shares for every game. Outside of the play-by-play data, we can also grab some basic player information (height, weight, age, draft position) from the NBA‚Äôs player information portal.\nThere are a couple of important data elements we use that we get from outside the NBA‚Äôs records. The first is starting lineup information - it turns out, everybody and their cousin has a twitter account or website with the projected starting lineups for every game, so we use one of them (for free) for lineup info.\nThe second is game lines from sportsbooks. The spread, total, and moneyline for NBA games typically have a lot of information in them, because it is influenced by 1) bookmakers, who have models and good info in most cases and 2) bettors, who can move the betting lines by making more and bigger wagers on one side than another. We track game lines from several sportsbooks.\nTo be clear, we‚Äôre not manually downloading a bunch of pdf‚Äôs or clicking into sportsbook apps and recording the odds in a spreadsheet. We use data science tools to programmatically access data from APIs (there are dozens of them! try the nba_api python library if that‚Äôs your jam), and add them to our data store. Most of the data we care about only update once a day, like play-by-play records from the previous day, but some of it is updated as often as every 30 minutes, like starting lineup information, and sportsbook lines.\nOnce we get the data, we have to do a bunch of additional work, including: validating that the data are sensible and not buggy or duplicated or other things that happen to data; label when jump balls and first baskets (and first other things) happen, and who does them, and the specific method it happened; engineer common and bespoke metrics, like efficiency, and first-basket-related usage rates, conditioned on specific lineups; aggregate statistics within games, and seasons, and players, and teams, and coaches, and different combinations of those levels, using lots of different operations; create rolling window functions so we can calculate metrics in specific windows of time or stretches of games; and then lots of recoding and normalizing to get things prepped for our modeling pipelines.\nWhew! It sounds like a lot when its all written out like this, but most of our data pipelines run in way less than an hour.\nLike most curious folks, we‚Äôre always on the lookout for additional data that can help our models perform better. I suspect that we‚Äôre getting as much information as we can out of the play-by-play data; we might benefit from adding additional coach-specific information into the models, if we think that there are coach-related patterns that might explain some variance in first basket/early game usage and success; or similar to coaching-related variance, there‚Äôs possibly some aspect of how a team is doing with respect to making the playoffs that could explain some variance as well.\nThe ultimate criteria for whether we use data in our models is, ‚Äúdoes it make the model better?‚Äù Which at this point is a high bar to cross üòé\nNext up is a deeper dive into the models themselves (not like a SUPER deep dive, but more than what was in the last post on this). Thanks for reading, and thanks even more if you subscribe!"

    "text": "Being able to estimate odds for first baskets is a nifty parlor trick that might give you something to talk about at a job interview or the bar or whatever, but unless we can find opportunities where our predictions can give us a betting edge, they‚Äôre not especially useful.\nFortunately, we can - and do - find edges aplenty! Here‚Äôs how.\nFirst, and we‚Äôre sure this goes entirely without saying, we don‚Äôt EVER violate or advocate that others violate the terms and conditions of service of sportsbook apps or websites. That‚Äôd be morally wrong, and would put us at risk of having our accounts limited even further or shut down entirely (or worse!). You should never break those, or any rules. Ever. Got it? Good.\nThat out of the way, we built some tools to get semi-realtime odds from the most popular books available in North America. This is a pain in the ass, because sportsbooks don‚Äôt want people to be able to shop around easily, and instead of putting in modernized safeguards against bad actors, the books just use the jankiest sets of data models and practices that you might expect out of a dorm room startup, which is like a ‚Äúsecurity by stupidity‚Äù strategy. We have opinions here, but we digress.\nOnce we get the odds, we have to reconcile them with our data. Books are intentionally inconsistent with how they list player and team names, and you‚Äôd be shocked at how often they misspell things or list players on the wrong teams, so we have to do some lightweight NLP to map everything together.\nAfter that, we built tools that identify cases where a book is offering odds that are at least 1% longer than what our model predicts. To explain: odds can be translated to probabilities; we compare the probabilities from our model to the odds offered by the books; if our model predicts a player has a 10% chance to score first in the game (translates exactly to +900), but a book offers that player at odds equivalent to 11.11% (+800), we see that 11.11% - 10% = 1.11% which is greater than our threshold.\nWe usually observe 1-6 edges per game at or beyond our threshold for first basket plays in both the NBA and WNBA. And that‚Äôs just for the first basket overall market - when you factor in the first basket by team and exact methods plays, we‚Äôre seeing between one and two dozen plays per game just on first basket markets.\nI know right? Bananas.\nEdited to Add: Dang I forgot about the recommended unit size calculations when I first published this. Our unit recommendations are just Kelly Criterion with a twist! We use Fully Kelly, but then we adjust based on the average unit size recommendation within a prop market, so that the average recommended bet within each market is 1 unit. This makes it a lot easier to calibrate your outlay based on a market‚Äôs ROI, e.g.¬†you can use a bigger unit for more profitable markets. (I bet people will have opinions about this.)\nAnyways, the next part of this will be about the alerts themselves, which involves some conversation about AI! Check it out, and also subscribe to the Discord if you haven‚Äôt yet, it helps us make tools and content üôè"

    "text": "I think this is gonna be the last part of the ‚ÄúHow Do You Predict First Baskets?‚Äù series of posts! Woohoo, we made it! The last post is on the alerts themselves - how do we make the edges we identify actionable for our users?\nWe run our modeling pipeline every 30 minutes, where we both update our predictions, and update the odds from the sportsbooks. Why 30 minutes? Primarily to avoid pissing off the books and triggering security measures that could break our tools for getting the odds; 30 minutes seemed to capture the important movements that happen within the day; and 30 minute intervals captured the majority of the different tipoff times of NBA games.\nSo every 30 minutes we have a batch of edges, and we send those to our Discord server, broken down by game, sorted by player from biggest edge to smallest, and sorted within player by books the biggest edge to smallest (we only show the edges for players, nothing that isn‚Äôt positive expected value).\nThe alerts also factor in what we‚Äôve alerted on already: some players we‚Äôve alrady alerted on earlier in the day, some players we‚Äôve already alerted on but the edges are bigger or smaller than before, and some players are brand new.\nWe indicate brand new players in a prop market (or teams for team-level props) with a üö® emoji, since these bets always require action from our users, i.e.¬†placing new bets. Similarly, when a player we‚Äôve already alerted on in the day has a new best edge for that day, we add a üöÄ to their entry; these are also cases where our users will likely want to take action and add more to their original bets.\nWhen a player‚Äôs best edge is no longer at it‚Äôs daily peak, we add a ‚¨áÔ∏è to the alert. This doesn‚Äôt require action by the user, unless they missed the previous alerts or didn‚Äôt place a wager then. But we include this information so that users can get an idea of how lines are moving around and when they might peak for different props or players.\nAn engaged reader might ask, ‚Äúare there peak times when lines are at their softest?‚Äù Great question! We‚Äôll tackle that one in a followup, but the answer is ‚ÄúYep‚Äù. More on that in a later post, so stay tuned.\nWe‚Äôre always trying to incrementally improve our alerts, by getting the odds faster (maybe someday the books will actually sell access to their odds APIs! nah jk they‚Äôre cowards), and calculating predictions in advance when we can.\nAnd there it is. From data to alerts, we‚Äôve covered the bases. Er, baskets. We‚Äôve covered the baskets. Thanks for reading, and if you haven‚Äôt, please subscribe!"

    "text": "Hello, thanks for visiting - and if you‚Äôre a subscriber, thanks even more!\nSlam Dunk Bets started predicting first baskets in 2020, mostly because sports betting was just becoming legal in Illinois, and one of the sports books was running consistent specials on the market.\nWe discovered that most of the available books were offering first basket props, and that the odds usually varied from book to book.\nThe play-by-play data for NBA games was freely available, and could be parsed effectively using data science tools. This enabled us to develop models using machine learning tools to predict the likelihood of players to score first in a game.\nOnce we refined our models, we learned that first baskets were relatively predictable. ‚ÄúRelatively‚Äù is doing a lot of work in that sentence, of course, but by nerdy machine learning model evaluation metrics, we felt pretty good.\nIn addition, we learned that popular players were typically overpriced compared to what our models expected, which we think makes sense: popular players typically get more action from bettors, so books can get away with setting their opening prices high.\nThe inverse was also true - less popular players were often very favorably priced compared to what our models expected, i.e.¬†they were often positive expected value (+EV). And that‚Äôs what we wanted to find!\nSo to answer the question we raised rhetorically, we started out focusing on first basket markets because: the data were available to build models; the models we built were useful at predicting the thing we wanted to predict; our model predictions enabled us to find +EV bets to make."
