    "text": "Our first post outlined why we bet on first baskets, but doesn‚Äôt say anything at all about how we do it. These next posts will give some more context on our approach for predicting first basket outcomes. This first post will be a super high-level run through the process. Heck, I can even make a little diagram!\n\nI‚Äôll walk through the boxes and arrows.\nFirst, we get a bunch of data from different sources, most importantly play-by-play records from the NBA and WNBA.\nWe use those data to flag the winning player for every jump ball, and who they beat, as well as which players and teams score first and how it happened.\nOnce the data are labeled, we build models to predict the winner of a jump ball between players A and B. These models enable us to predict which team is going to possess the ball first, and knowing which team will possess the ball first is hugely predictive of which team will score first.\nWe could stop here, because ‚Äúplayer to win the tipoff‚Äù and ‚Äúteam to score first‚Äù are popular prop markets in their own rights, but we keep going! Independent of first possession, we can also model which player will score first for their team given a specific lineup; this is also a very popular (and profitable) prop market. Even more, we model out the odds of a player scoring first for their team with a specific method, like a free throw or a three pointer.\nFinally, we can use the outputs of the team to score first and player to score first for their team models, to estimate the odds of a player scoring first for the entire game (and the method they use). Tada!\nNow that you‚Äôve got the high level view, we can start looking more specifically at different parts of the process. We can start with the data!"

    "text": "Hello, thanks for visiting - and if you‚Äôre a subscriber, thanks even more!\nSlam Dunk Bets started predicting first baskets in 2020, mostly because sports betting was just becoming legal in Illinois, and one of the sports books was running consistent specials on the market.\nWe discovered that most of the available books were offering first basket props, and that the odds usually varied from book to book.\nThe play-by-play data for NBA games was freely available, and could be parsed effectively using data science tools. This enabled us to develop models using machine learning tools to predict the likelihood of players to score first in a game.\nOnce we refined our models, we learned that first baskets were relatively predictable. ‚ÄúRelatively‚Äù is doing a lot of work in that sentence, of course, but by nerdy machine learning model evaluation metrics, we felt pretty good.\nIn addition, we learned that popular players were typically overpriced compared to what our models expected, which we think makes sense: popular players typically get more action from bettors, so books can get away with setting their opening prices high.\nThe inverse was also true - less popular players were often very favorably priced compared to what our models expected, i.e.¬†they were often positive expected value (+EV). And that‚Äôs what we wanted to find!\nSo to answer the question we raised rhetorically, we started out focusing on first basket markets because: the data were available to build models; the models we built were useful at predicting the thing we wanted to predict; our model predictions enabled us to find +EV bets to make."
